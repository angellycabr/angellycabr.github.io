# Projects

- **AI-driven plant monitoring system**: Led the creation of an AI plant monitoring system using ATMega3289P microcontroller. Developed schematics, programmed sensors, and integrated sensor data into an unsupervised learning model for anomaly detection.
- **Flick Pick - a collaborative filtering-based Chrome extension**: Collaborated with a team to develop a Chrome extension that utilizes collaborative filtering to create personalized film recommendations on popular streaming sites.
- **Electric guitar with notch-filter for signal attenuation**: Designed and constructed an electric guitar featuring a custom notch filter, enabling precise signal amplification and targeted frequency rejection.
- **Raspberry Pi-based k-means for music genre classification**: Developed a Raspberry Pi-based k-means classification model utilizing volume sensor data to classify music genres and generate song recommendations.
- **Metal matrix reinforced shape-memory alloy tires**: Collaborated on a proposal for self-repairing alloy tires, emphasizing material properties and stress analysis. The proposal was successfully accepted into NASA's New Technology Report database.
