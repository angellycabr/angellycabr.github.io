Projects
======
- **Plant Health Monitoring System** (Capstone): Built a microcontroller-based system using sensor input and unsupervised learning to detect early plant stress. [GitHub](https://github.com/angellycabr/EE459-Capstone), [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PXUxTM1k-A52hX0pVLlwrbkTVt2UJnyvwdPqTQYM5PQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- **FPGA-Based Platform Game Controller** (Final Project): Developed a retro-inspired platformer using Verilog on the Nexys 4 FPGA board. [GitHub](https://github.com/angellycabr/MarioVGA)
- **Flick Pick Chrome Extension** (Hackathon): Created a Chrome extension that applies collaborative filtering to generate personalized movie recommendations. [GitHub](https://github.com/kyleburgess2025/movie-prediction)
- **Electric guitar with notch filter for signal attenuation**: Designed and constructed an electric guitar featuring a custom notch filter, enabling precise signal amplification and targeted frequency rejection.
- **Raspberry Pi-based k-means for music genre classification**: Developed a Raspberry Pi-based k-means classification model utilizing volume sensor data to classify music genres and generate song recommendations. [GitHub](https://github.com/angellycabr/EE250-Final-Project)
- **Metal matrix reinforced shape-memory alloy tires**: Collaborated on a proposal for self-repairing alloy tires, emphasizing material properties and stress analysis. The proposal was successfully accepted into NASA's New Technology Report database.
