I recently completed my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California, where I specialized in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My interest in research began at sixteen while interning at USC's Single Molecule Biophotonics Lab, where I studied protein interactions in the development of Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy. As an undergraduate, I've been recognized as a Presidential Scholar, Viterbi Fellow, and a Ming Hsieh Institute Undergraduate Research Scholar. My work has also been recognized by the National Center for Women & IT.

I am passionate about human-centered technology. My work spans affective, ecological, and social computing, from identifying emotional distress in children to detecting early-stage crop disease and improving hate speech detection. I am seeking opportunities that allow me to explore socially impactful applications of AI in areas related to affective and social computing.
