As a first-generation Latina in STEM, I've grappled firsthand with imposter syndrome. I understand the hardships that accompany growing up first-generation and low-income and the challenges of navigating the transition to higher education. Therefore, outreach is deeply important to me. I was privileged to participate in many outreach efforts during my undergraduate studies. Below is a collection of presentations, publications, and other media from said outreach. 

Presentations:
