As a first-generation Latina in STEM, I've grappled firsthand with impostor syndrome. I understand the hardships that accompany growing up first-generation and low-income and the challenges of navigating the transition to higher education. Therefore, outreach is deeply important to me. I was privileged to participate in many outreach efforts during my undergraduate studies. Below is a collection of presentations, publications, and other media from said outreach. 

Summary of Outreach
======
- **USC Viterbi K–12 STEM Center**   January 2024 – April 2024  
  • Designed and led AI workshops for K–12 students from local schools, including interactive sessions on generative AI using Google Colab.  
  • Co-hosted USC’s booth at the LA Maker Faire, educating families on the fundamentals of unsupervised learning through hands-on demos.
- **Break Through Tech**   April 2023 – March 2024  
  • Organized outreach events across Southern California to encourage women to explore careers in machine learning and data science through the fellowship.  
  • Led an interactive workshop at UCR’s SHPEtinas conference on algorithmic bias, discussing how models encode inequality and why Latine representation in AI is important.
- **Ming Hsieh Institute Research Scholar**   April 2023 – May 2024  
  • Selected as one of five undergraduates to receive departmental recognition for research and community impact.  
  • Organized events to connect students with research opportunities, including workshops on CV writing, REU applications, and department lab sessions.
