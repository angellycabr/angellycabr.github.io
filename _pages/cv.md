Education
======
* B.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California, 2024

Research Experience
======
**University of Southern California**, Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory  
*Monitoring Productivity in the Workplace*  January 2024 – Present  
- Performed statistical tests on physiological and survey data to analyze feature variability in stress, mood, and productivity across work environments.
- Built and optimized a random forest classifier for self-reported attributes using mean imputation, z-score normalization, and hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.

*Leaf Rust Detection on Low-Resolution Images*  August 2023 – Present 
- Developed deep-learning models for early detection of leaf rust in coffee leaves, achieving 94% precision and recall by performing image convolution and downsizing.
- Modified existing datasets to improve lesion-leaf contrast and trained convolutional models on low-resolution images, enhancing detection capabilities for crop disease identification.

*Semantic Deep Learning for Sarcastic Hate Speech Detection*  April 2024 – May 2024
- Developed and optimized two deep learning models using BERT embeddings and LSTM layers to effectively detect and categorize nuanced forms of hate speech and sarcasm.
- Integrated multiple datasets to create a novel, unified framework that addresses the gap in detecting implicit hate speech and sarcasm.

*Wearable Bio-Sensing for Family Well-Being*  January 2022 – December 2023    
- Engineered preprocessing scripts to convert raw biometric data from wearable devices into datasets, enabling early detection of emotional distress in adolescents through supervised learning.
- Collaborated with psychology researchers to integrate audio transformers and extract event tags from audio data, enhancing biometric analysis to identify signs of inter-family conflict.
