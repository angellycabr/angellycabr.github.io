Education
======
* B.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California, 2024

Research Experience
======
- **Sarcasm-Enhanced Hate Speech Detection**   April 2024 – Present  
  • Proposed and developed a BERT-BiLSTM model to detect implicit hate speech in sarcastic or coded language often missed by current state-of-the-art systems.  
  • Employed sarcasm pretraining and sequential transfer learning to improve model performance, achieving 71% precision and 88% recall.  
  • Established sarcasm pretraining as a performance-enhancing strategy, improving hate speech detection by 7% across all metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
- **Monitoring Productivity in the Workplace**   January 2024 – March 2024  
  • Performed statistical tests on physiological and survey data to analyze feature variability in stress, mood, and productivity across work environments.  
  • Built and optimized a random forest classifier for self-reported attributes using mean imputation, z-score normalization, and hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.
- **Leaf Rust Detection on Low-Resolution Images**   August 2023 – July 2023  
  • Investigated performance limitations of disease detection models on low-resolution imagery common in field applications, focusing specifically on coffee leaf rust.  
  • Enhanced lesion contrast through high-pass filtering to improve model learnability.  
  • Designed and trained CNNs for early coffee rust detection, achieving 94% precision and recall.
- **Wearable Bio-Sensing for Family Well-Being**   January 2022 – December 2023  
  • Engineered preprocessing scripts to convert biometric data from wearable devices into datasets with daily metrics, such as sleep analysis, for each participant across 14 families.  
  • Applied audio transformers to extract event tags (e.g., yelling, crying) from recordings, creating detailed histograms of speech patterns to help identify inter-family dynamics.

Professional Experience
======
- **Software Engineering Intern**, Microsoft & Cyborg Mobile — IC3 (M365 Substrate)   May 2024 – August 2024  
  • Developed a C# console application to host and migrate Microsoft Teams performance testing services from Azure Classic Cloud to Kubernetes following its deprecation.  
  • Containerized testing services with Docker, deployed to Kubernetes using YAML, and automated XML-based performance tests via Azure Pipelines.
- **Software Engineering Intern**, Microsoft & Cyborg Mobile — E+D (M365 Substrate)   May 2023 – August 2023  
  • Developed a data extraction, analysis, and storage pipeline using LLMs, KQL, and cloud databases to summarize incident reports, identify patterns, and generate visuals.  
  • Applied language transformers to match predicted patterns, achieving 90% accuracy in predictions and 73% precision in similarity matching.
- **Break Through Tech AI Fellow**, University of California, Los Angeles — Verizon Team (Finalist)   June 2022 – April 2023  
  • Compiled a dataset and trained an object detection model to classify smartphones by brand and color for inventory tracking, achieving 96% confidence and 98% precision.  
  • Collaborated with Verizon data scientists to design a color-sorting method using bounding boxes, RGB histograms, and Euclidean distance to distinguish 800+ color variations.
- **New Technologist Intern**, Microsoft & Cyborg Mobile   June 2022 – August 2022  
  • Developed a real-time climate and emergency resource web app using React JS, integrating weather and air quality APIs to generate forecasts and provide health-based alerts.  
  • Built an MVP allowing users to register health conditions and receive warnings for unsafe air quality or extreme weather, using map APIs to direct them to nearby safety shelters.
