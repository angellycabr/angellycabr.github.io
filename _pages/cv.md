Education
======
* B.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California, 2024

Research Experience
======
**University of Southern California**, Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory  
*Monitoring Productivity in the Workplace*  January 2024 – Present  
Advisor: Dr. Shrikanth Narayanan  
- Performed statistical tests on physiological and survey data to analyze feature variability in stress, mood, and productivity across work environments.
- Built and optimized a random forest classifier for self-reported attributes using mean imputation, z-score normalization, and hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.

*Leaf Rust Detection on Low-Resolution Images*  August 2023 – Present 
Advisor: Dr. Shrikanth Narayanan  
- Developed deep-learning models for early detection of leaf rust in coffee leaves, achieving 94% precision and recall by performing image convolution and downsizing.
- Modified existing datasets to improve lesion-leaf contrast and trained convolutional models on low-resolution images, enhancing detection capabilities for crop disease identification.

*Semantic Deep Learning for Sarcastic Hate Speech Detection*  April 2024 – May 2024
Course Instructor: Dr. Antonio Ortega  
- Developed and optimized two deep learning models using BERT embeddings and LSTM layers to effectively detect and categorize nuanced forms of hate speech and sarcasm.
- Integrated multiple datasets to create a novel, unified framework that addresses the gap in detecting implicit hate speech and sarcasm.

*Wearable Bio-Sensing for Family Well-Being*  January 2022 – December 2023  
Advisor: Dr. Shrikanth Narayanan  
- Engineered preprocessing scripts to convert raw biometric data from wearable devices into datasets, enabling early detection of emotional distress in adolescents through supervised learning.
- Collaborated with psychology researchers to integrate audio transformers and extract event tags from audio data, enhancing biometric analysis to identify signs of inter-family conflict.

Professional Experience
======
**Microsoft & Cyborg Mobile**  May 2024 – August 2024  
*Software Engineering Intern, IC3 (M365 Substrate)*  
- Developed a console application for the Media Controller team to host toolkit services for performance testing, migrating these services from Azure Classic Cloud to Azure Kubernetes to support Microsoft Teams backend.
- Containerized a .NET console application with Docker, deployed it to Azure Kubernetes via Azure Pipelines, and created a stress test profile to ensure reliable communication with the Media Controller service.

**Microsoft & Cyborg Mobile**  May 2023 – August 2023  
*Software Engineering Intern, E+D (M365 Substrate)*  
- Led the development of an automated data extraction, analysis, and storage pipeline, utilizing large language models, prompt engineering, natural language processing, and cloud analytics to identify trends across 300 post-mortem incidents, summarizing months of reports in under 10 minutes.
- Presented the final product to the Vice President of Microsoft Substrate Fabric, demonstrating the operation of the pipeline, resulting in the team receiving additional funding to pursue similar projects.

**University of California, Los Angeles** June 2022 – April 2023  
*Break Through Tech AI Fellow, Verizon & Google*  
- Created datasets and trained an object detection model to sort phones by brand and color, achieving 96% confidence and 98% precision.
- Collaborated with Verizon engineers on a color sorting algorithm using Euclidean distance, capable of predicting over 800 colors for inventory tracking and product recommendations.
- Engineered a recommendation system to predict users' movie ratings for a Google-sponsored Kaggle competition, achieving first place for preliminary round submissions.

**Microsoft & Cyborg Mobile**  June 2022 – August 2022  
*New Technologist Intern*  
- Engaged in a seven-week academy to learn the product management lifecycle, applying these skills to develop a real-time climate data and emergency resources web application to inform communities facing extreme weather events.
- Implemented web APIs, designed wireframes and UI layouts, and wrote an engineering specification to develop a minimum viable product that was presented to Microsoft executives.
